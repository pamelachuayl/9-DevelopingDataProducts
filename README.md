===================

This Shiny App is a car chooser app based on the Kelly Blue Book resale data for 2005 model year GM cars (obtained from the 'cars' data from the caret library).

The user can select on various parameters and the app will show the relevant cars (Model type together with the price and mileage) that fit their selected criteria.

The relevant files for this project are ui.R and server.R

You can view the Shiny app by either:
1) Going directly to http://pamelachuayl.shinyapps.io/9-DevelopingDataProducts

2) Download ui.R and server.R files and deploy them locally on your computer using runApp().
